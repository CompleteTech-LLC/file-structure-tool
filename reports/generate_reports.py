"""
Generate File Reports
---------------------
This script provides commands (functions) to enumerate all files known to the
FileStructureTool, collect their names and contents, and generate comprehensive
reports.

Usage Example (CLI):
--------------------
    python -m file_structure_tool.reports.generate_reports

Functionalities:
----------------
1) List all files along with their full paths and contents.
2) Generate a single README-like file summarizing the entire module.
3) Print or save this data to output files as desired.

Implementation Details:
-----------------------
- Relies on the `FileStructureTool` to read the existing file structure JSON.
- Iterates through directories and files to retrieve contents from disk.
- Merges them into a unified Markdown report.

NOTE:
-----
- Assumes files exist on disk matching the structure in the JSON representation.
- Error handling is minimal for demonstration purposes.
